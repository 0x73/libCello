__What is C+?__

C+ is some kind of C library which I have created using ideas from C++, Haskell and Python. It isn't really half way between C and C++ but more like a C with interfaces, dynamic typing, and some sugar.

__Why would you do something like this?__

Primarily for fun and learning but I ar it in production code, although I'd love to say it would make a cute little scripting language for C/C++ based applications.

__Why the weird terminology?__

Most of the terminology is taken from Haskell. What I don't enjoy in Haskell is writing algorithms in a functional style. But I do love the way it (and C) programs are structured at a higher level. C will never be object oriented but I hope that with C+ I've turned it into something of a dynamic and powerful functional language (with manual memory management).

__Does this break anything?__

There are a selection of new keywords and many functions in the namespace are taken but other than that it should be fully compatible with normal C99 code.
